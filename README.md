# SQL-Revision-day-9-
### Day 9 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and Filtering Data in MySQL by Indexing and Views. I have selected data from tables which was created from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days! based on the information you've provided about your tables (customers, employees, orders, orderdetails, products, and productlines).

## This CTE creates a temporary result set that summarizes the total order value for each customer. The main query then selects all columns from this summary.
